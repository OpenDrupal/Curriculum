# The Open Drupal Curriculum (ODC) project.
aka: Project Odyssey

## 2024 Reboot

We're rebooting the OpenDrupal project, starting with ODC, a community-driven curriculum.

## What's this all about?
It's hard for newcomers to figure out what they need to learn, how, and in what order, to beat the infamous Drupal learning curve.

It's hard for organizations to compare training providers; training offers can vary wildly in content and quality.

As a first step, this project aims to build a community-driven curriculum that can serve as a baseline for training providers.

> What's a **curriculum**?  
> In our context, a curriculum a set of learning outcomes, grouped by career path.  
> The goal is not to create learning materials, but a shared roadmap toward becoming a proficient Site Builder / Module Developer / ...

For the time being, developing the curriculum is this project's main focus.

## How?
1. Establish a core set of Drupal career personas that are the target audience for Drupal training.
2. Develop a comprehensive training curriculum for each persona.

## Who?
Anyone interested. Please open an issue to request access.

Note: As the former iteration of this project was mostly dead for several years, all members except the original owners have been removed. If you were a member previously and would like to actively participate again, by all means open an issue.
